# MLOps_with_VertexAI_on_Google_Cloud_Platform

**1. Introduction - Vertex AI for ML Operations**
- Introduction to the playlist of end-to-end workflow walkthroughs for machine learning operations using Google Cloud Platformâ€™s Vertex AI. 

**2. Environment Setup - Vertex AI for ML Operations [notebook 00]**
- A walkthrough of creating a Google Cloud Platform project and setting up the environment for this series of end-to-end workflows.   This video follows the readme and the first notebook [00 - Environment Setup] in the repository.

**3. Data Source - Vertex AI for ML Operations [notebook 01]**
- A walkthrough of creating the data source for this project using BigQuery. We will import, review, and prepare the data for use in machine learning workflows.  This video follows the notebook [01 - BigQuery - Table Data Source] in the repository.

**4. End-To-End: No Code - AutoML in Vertex AI for ML Operations [notebook 02a]**
- An end-to-end workflow completely within the Vertex AI interface in the Google Cloud Console. We will use AutoML to train a machine learning model.  A walkthrough of all the steps from connecting to data sources, training a model, evaluating the final model, deploying to an online endpoint and requesting predictions from multiple clients.  A few deep dives along the way!  This video follows the notebook 02a - Vertex AI - AutoML in GCP Console (no code).
